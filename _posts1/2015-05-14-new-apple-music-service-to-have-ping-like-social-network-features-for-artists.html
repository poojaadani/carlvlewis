<p style="text-align: justify;">Apple’s upcoming music streaming service, which is based on the recently <a href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.tech.firstpost.com%2Fnews-analysis%2Fapple-buys-beats-for-3-billion-5-things-to-know-about-the-deal-224657.html&amp;ei=w1NUVdXULYGdugSLjoAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHj9iqc-XuCG4JcczNCC-ja-or_Zg&amp;bvm=bv.93112503,d.c2E" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>acquired Beats</strong></a>, will reportedly be dubbed Apple Music. What is rather interesting is that this new service will be resemble Apple’s now-defunct Ping social networking system, which was officially closed on September 30, 2012 and replaced with Facebook and Twitter integration in iTunes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to a report by 9to5mac , Apple Music will allow artists to have their own pages within the streaming music service that they can use to post track samples, photos, videos and concert updates as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The report also added that artists can share content of other artists, in an attempt of ‘cross-promotion’. With an iTunes account, users can comment and like these posts but unlike Ping, users will not have their own social network profile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The report adds, ‘Artists Activity will be a core feature of the ‘Apple Music’ streaming service’. Users will be able to discontinue this feature in the Settings feature of iOS 8.4. It is being said that parents will be able to enable or disable this feature so as to enable or disable restrictions on content from artists. The new feature will be available for iOS, Mac as well as Android. Apple’s new streaming music service is most likely to make a debut at the Worldwide Developer Conference on June 8.</p>
