<p style="text-align: justify;">Your Android smartphone/tablet is your very own personal haven of everything ranging from memories to sensitive data. In fact it's a small part of your own self. Well, if it's so private, it's also important that you keep it that way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have compiled here some really cool tips and tricks coming straight from Google's global Android team giving you step by step instructions on how to keep your android device safe.</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Make sure Android Device Manager is on</b>: The Android Device Manager comes into play when your device is stolen or misplaced. Remember to have Android Device Manager set up on your device. Make sure to sign in with your Google Account and turn on "Remotely locate this device" and "Allow remote lock and erase." Should your phone land in the wrong hands, you can always relocate it, and remotely lock and erase all the data that lies therein.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Set a Screen Lock</b>: Set up a screen lock with a PIN, password, or pattern to ensure your phone cannot be accessed by anyone but yourself. You can do this by going to Settings &gt; Security &gt; Screen lock.<br />
In case you have Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher running on your phone, you can also choose to have your device automatically unlock when you have it with you using the Smart Lock for Android feature.</li>
