<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="advenueINTEXT">When the internet was created, it had space for 4.3 billion addresses. That might seem a lot — but soon we're likely to run out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://localhost/test/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/webadd.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-112 alignleft" src="assets/webadd.jpg" alt="webadd" width="290" height="217" /></a><span id="advenueINTEXT">There are only 3.4 million addresses left in North America, and those are likely to run out in summer, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, businesses have to make the expensive move towards a new specification — IPv6, rather than the old IPv4 — which will never run out.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="advenueINTEXT">An IP address is a short series of numbers with three dots between it, like 194.66.82.11. They're used by computers and servers to identify themselves to each other, allowing for connections to be made and websites and other information to be sent.<br />
But those four sets of numbers limit the amount of different ad dresses that can be used.<br />
The maximum 4.3 billion possibilities is a result of the relatively small amount of different combinations. The new specification has ce for 340 undecillion address space for 340 undecillion address es, or 340 followed by 36 zeroes That's enough to give every atom on Earth its own IP address. It was made in response to the reducing capacity . By using longer and more complex addresses, the Internet Engineering Task Force that invented it were able to make a lot more space.<br />
